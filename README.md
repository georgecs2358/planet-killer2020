# Planet Killer 2020 (Beta)

https://planetkiller2020.herokuapp.com

A final, more user-friendly version will be coming shortly.

A turn based Sci-Fi game based on concepts in the film Star Wars: A New Hope. An appreciation of the Star Wars universe and the desire to deepen my understanding of Object Oriented Programming led to its development.

Edits/comments are welcome

*Fictional locations and characters present in this game are property of the Walt Disney Company, I do not seek to profit from this project*

# Updates are coming soon; the UI is currently being reworked to be more user friendly. Currently only 3 people know how to use it properly hahah
